# DawgBot
Short bot project made for school, may revisit and add to later.

Multiple commands such as boot and ping which are pretty self explanatory.

If you want to run on your own server just make sure you change the token at the bottom in bot.run to whatever server you want to be using.

Biggest feature is that it will collect logs and put them into a text file for you.
